Palindrome Checker
==================
A [palindrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)  is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. Famous examples include "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Amor, Roma", "race car", "taco cat", and "No 'x' in Nixon".

Suggested steps to complete this assignment
-------------------------------------------

1. Fork and clone down this repository.


2. Run the program. You should see the following output:  
there are 6 lines  
test is NOT a palidrome.  
rotator is NOT a palidrome.  
rewriter is NOT a palidrome.  
nurses run is NOT a palidrome.  
Madam, I'm Adam! is NOT a palidrome.  
A Man! A Plan! A Canal! Panama! is NOT a palidrome.  


3. Start by finishing the `reverse()` and `palindrome()` methods. You'll want the program to print that `"rotator"` is a palindrome and `'"test"` and `"rewriter"` are not palindromes.


4. Once you get those three working correctly, you'll need to devise a strategy for working with spaces and capital letters. You may find the custom codingbat problems [noSpaces](http://codingbat.com/prob/p240112?parent=/home/simona1@sfusd.edu), [numLetters](http://codingbat.com/prob/p285953?parent=/home/simona1@sfusd.edu) and [noCapitals](http://codingbat.com/prob/p259800?parent=/home/simona1@sfusd.edu) helpful.


5. Submit the URL of your GitHub repository to the School Loop drop box for the assignment. Note that like the previous two assignments, this assignment has no graphics or website.
